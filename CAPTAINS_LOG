23/08/19
Epoch for software arch.

24/08/19
Received ir sensors.
Completed IMU calibration interface.

28/08/19
All tasks listings.

29/08/19
8:52 AM
Controller Epoch
8:56 PM
Encoder testing successful.
someone burned out 1 prototype motor.

30/08/19
6.32 PM
IR sensors testing init.
8.02 PM
IRs are fucked up. Shows 5v op accross LEDs no rev bias current.

3/09/19
Revised design issues, Green ye youtube guy was a huge help.

4/09/19
Aimed to complete IMU yaw values and sensor fusion and
look into Software OS (pref sEOS or systic timers).
9.34pm
Dont know how my code is running the first time ?
Code and design completed for kalman6d used matlabC coder.
(now you know how :) )

5/09/19
Corrected/modified kalman code Successfully imported and run kalman code in main.ino
Looked into curved turnings.
Research on timers.
Thinking of moving to standard embedded IDEs instead of Arduino IDE for timer simplicity and using sEOS or systic time settings.

6/09/19
12.20pm
Going forward with arduino IDE, not using embedded codes.
New changes in kalman code reverifying needed.

10/09/19
10 days to competetion
Completed IR firing pattern code.
Purchased batteries 850mAhx2 ~40C, motor driver ICs l293d x2, Bought new IR pairs(x10) for IR sensor module.

11/09/19
9 days to go
Resolved IR header object issues.
Resolved IR hardware issue, entire batch of IR leds were soldered reverse.
Programmed basic IO for kalman and other vars via global vars.

12/09/19
8 days to go.
Looked into Floodfill algorithm / advanced algos for better solving .See references.
Looked 3d printing skid pads.
voltage checker algo.
Debug test codes.

17/09/19
Looked into Floodfill algorithm got codes for them.

18/09/19
File inclusion for mazes and speed profiler codes.

19/09/19
HWARE DEBUGGING.

17/12/19 
BEEN A LONG TIME 
COMPETETION ON JAN3 '20 
ABOUT 16 days remaining
1.21PM 
FINISHED TESTING NIGEL WEBB ENCODER CODE TEST 
INTEGRATION REMAINING |
 TODAYS AIM 
INTEGRATE CODES FOR MOTORS AND TEST AND GET DONE WITH MOTOR ISSUES
10.04 PM 
DONE INTEGRATING AND FIXING MOTORS AND CODES 
ISSUES/NOTES 
TIM 1 is 16 bit timer hence values only until 62235

Whats remaining ??
TRACK TESTING AND CALIBRATION
S1 - GET A TRACK 
S2 - CALIBRATE REMAINING sensors ----------------------------------------------------

18/12/19
Done with the TRACK

19/12/19
11.05AM 
Calibration for encoders started.
Timer for clock is needed.
About 1106 steps for 18cm ie 
TO DO 
TEST IMU modified code 
(shites ) using yawGyro

CAlC current speed and w
done ish.

Do path planner and speed profiler.
Aim 
resolve controller parameters
Well before that I need to the state estimation problem
CAn i do it without something complex YES.


Get w from encoders. THAT FORMULA IS FOR CURVE TURN W 


20/12/19 
9.45 PM 
THE 2nd 7805 burned up, in one day. SHITES AGAIN.
Considering to add a 2nd 7805 POWER SUPPLY TO BALANCE IT.
