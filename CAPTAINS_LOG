IRs are fucked up. Shows 5v op accross LEDs no rev bias current.

3/09/19
Revised design issues, Green ye youtube guy was a huge help.

4/09/19
Aimed to complete IMU yaw values and sensor fusion and
look into Software OS (pref sEOS or systic timers).
9.34pm
Dont know how my code is running the first time ?
Code and design completed for kalman6d used matlabC coder.
(now you know how :) )

5/09/19
Corrected/modified kalman code Successfully imported and run kalman code in main.ino
Looked into curved turnings.
Research on timers.
Thinking of moving to standard embedded IDEs instead of Arduino IDE for timer simplicity and using sEOS or systic time settings.

6/09/19
12.20pm
Going forward with arduino IDE, not using embedded codes.
New changes in kalman code reverifying needed.

10/09/19
10 days to competetion
Completed IR firing pattern code.
Purchased batteries 850mAhx2 ~40C, motor driver ICs l293d x2, Bought new IR pairs(x10) for IR sensor module.

11/09/19
9 days to go
Resolved IR header object issues.
Resolved IR hardware issue, entire batch of IR leds were soldered reverse.
Programmed basic IO for kalman and other vars via global vars.

12/09/19
8 days to go.
Looked into Floodfill algorithm / advanced algos for better solving .See references.
Looked 3d printing skid pads.
voltage checker algo.
Debug test codes.

17/09/19
Looked into Floodfill algorithm got codes for them.

18/09/19
File inclusion for mazes and speed profiler codes.

HWARE DEBUGGING.

17/12/19 
BEEN A LONG TIME 
COMPETETION ON JAN3 '20 
ABOUT 16 days remaining
1.21PM 
FINISHED TESTING NIGEL WEBB ENCODER CODE TEST 
INTEGRATION REMAINING |
 TODAYS AIM 
INTEGRATE CODES FOR MOTORS AND TEST AND GET DONE WITH MOTOR ISSUES
10.04 PM 
DONE INTEGRATING AND FIXING MOTORS AND CODES 
ISSUES/NOTES 
TIM 1 is 16 bit timer hence values only until 62235

Whats remaining ??
TRACK TESTING AND CALIBRATION
S1 - GET A TRACK 
S2 - CALIBRATE REMAINING sensors ----------------------------------------------------

18/12/19
Done with the TRACK

19/12/19
11.05AM 
Calibration for encoders started.
Timer for clock is needed.
About 1106 steps for 18cm ie 
TO DO 
TEST IMU modified code 
(shites ) using yawGyro

CAlC current speed and w
done ish.

Do path planner and speed profiler.
Aim 
resolve controller parameters
Well before that I need to the state estimation problem
CAn i do it without something complex YES.


Get w from encoders. THAT FORMULA IS FOR CURVE TURN W 


20/12/19 
9.45 PM 
THE 2nd 7805 burned up, in one day. SHITES AGAIN.
Considering to add a 2nd 7805 POWER SUPPLY TO BALANCE IT.
 

 22/12/19
 12.51 AM 
 BOUGHT THE BUCK CONVERTER(x3 just in case. ...) YESTERDAY( technically )
 Soldered it, runs good.
 Found the issue causing the PWM pin trouble, had declared motor objects in actuactor.cpp
 PART 2 
 GET EACH FUNCTIONS RUNTIME AND PROGRAM SYSTICK TIMER ? 
 Why systick ? Dont know , confused if dt chages vfrequnetly .....
 Either way need to test runtime of each function
How do I test runtimes in PIO CODE ?

One way declare t.start at beginning of each function being tested ...
2 way LOOK ONline.
GOING WITH 1st option coz of procastination ...
looked 2nd option .. not much use

Starting with major functions ...
main_controller - shows 57us 
WHOA ... 
MAYBE I CAN FIX ALL OF IT WITHIN 1MS 
MAYBE ..


TRYing to line all functions TO GET TOTAL TIME EXECUTION.


23/12/19

s1 run all functions and get total runtime.
s2 merge 
s3 ..

Starting with finishing all the functions
1 encoder


24/12/19 
back to IRs they had low power soldered 6pnp transistors for higher power 
Testing today for performance
day wasted ...
YESTERDAY and today literally, way too ugly to debug things


25/12/19 
12.14 AM
Switching back to supplying IRs from the microcontroller only let better have 25mA power than no power ...
8 days to go.

WOULD I BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THIS ?
LETS BE HOPEFUL ...

9.09 AM 
Merry Xmas , not so merry 
debugging one pnp 

Moved on with IMU takes  -373.6619743981135 
Does take 50MS 
URGENT NEED FOR TTH architecture. 
SED.
Nop 
its sort spooky , like spooky effect of electrons.
When measuring the val via debuggers the val changes continiously and randomly but when printing it normally the val is constant.
IDK IT TOOK 1MS to process the calc inside it, assuming just go with it.

6.25 PM 
Calibrated IMU ....Finally still don't know the runtime of the function. Coz of the spooky effct or maybe an interrupt is there maybe ... 
Dont know ...

Need to limit to -180 to 180 // To be integrated with path planning Major issue.

7.20 PM 
done with good IMU calib and encoder calib for one revolution.
PS 870 counts = 1 revolution/rotation. of motor.


******IMPortant************
Other Facts and calib stats 
1 deg bot yaw =  diff of 14.29 counts.
1 cm of wheel dist = 50.74 enc counts.


For reference 
****WHEEL 1DEGREEE*** 2.41counts
****WHEEL 360DEGREEE*** 870counts or one revolution.

26/12/19 
11.32AM 
IRs super forked up now, since transistors were not working I **cut them OFF**
Now IR led module separated from the board.
All IRS ARE WORKING at 3.3v except SR IR Led.
that led works at 5v, need to change resistor vals.

With having no patience I am moving forward with main_controller calibration and testing.


FUNNY THINGY I HADN'T called THAT FUNCTION>.>>>. 
USELESSLY CUT THE transistor wires.

27/12/19
4.46AM
tried everything ... 
Cleaned the old iron resoldered the entire transistor and cutted wires. cleaned the board a bit, BUT STILL NO LUCK 
Finally switched back to normal,  thingsarent working quite as expected.
except sl all good

1.27PM 
there Fixed it ...

7.39PM
track ready.
Now need to test.

8.48PM
FIXING BACK TO the ol' edfault code it works fine adding some tunings **WITHOUT** modifying anything old.

Writing STARTUP SELF CALIB SEQUENCE for IMU COZ offset changes everytime for every run according to refresh rate.
2 things need to be done.
Self calibration and main controller.

2.10 PM 
Deciding a step by step procedure for debugging.
S1. Before beginning anything see CAPTAINS_LOG what was done previously.
S2. analyse it, see if is complete or left partially.
s2.2 If partial, complete it, comment it, commit it and push it.
s3. Take a break every 30 mins wash eyes and stuff, every 15 mins walk.

S4. Begin that days task, by writing what you will be doing that day.
S4.2 Write as you complete wach sub task here.
S5 complete, comment, commit and PUSH.
S6 REPEAT 

 TIP - COMPLETE,debug,commit,PUSH, small blocks of code say every 50 lines or so.
