/* xej-Nucleo-F401RE-and-HC05-Bluetooth.cpp
  Test Nucleo-F401RE with HC05 Bluetooth adapter
  
  Wanted to use it for upload of telemetry
  type a command and hc053 port and it will be echoed back
  
  
  pin-HC05  Pin-MBed
   TX   --- PA_12
   RX   --- PA_11
   +5V  --- +5 on CN6
               Also worked on 3.3V on CN6
   GND  --- GND on CN6
   STATE--- NC - not connected
   EN   --- NC - not connected
  
   If you cycle power on mbed you may need to close 
   and re-open the port connection which
   is pretty easy when using RealTerm.
  
   tested with HonbayÂ® Wireless Bluetooth Host Serial Transceiver Module   
   Draws about 30mA when starting then drops back
   to 10mA when idle with a jump to about 20 mA 
   when transmitting.
