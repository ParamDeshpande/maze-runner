IR Emmiter Single 
Preferably used for single / side turns

Emmiter Serial 
To be used for diagonal IR led pairs

IR receiver
80 microsec *micro* cooldown period

Ideally send IR pulses at 60 *micro*sec and measure IR receiver value during that at the ~end of pulse where PEAK value exists.
Wait 80 *micro*sec before firing the NEXT IR sensor.

t = 0			60				140			200
TX1 Fired 				 
RX1 		Measured
					cooldown	
TX2  							Fired
RX2  									Measured

Gyro Zero Point Drift 
Keep gyro stable for 50000(50K values).(Sample that many values).
Measure /integrate to get a rough Angle (let it be in rads and dont simplify it(ie dont assume a cycle after 2PI values)).
Let that VVLarge angle be Y.
Later when calc angle 
Use (sampled_value*50K - Y)/50K as your measured angle.


Controller 

Lateral(rep by w) controller 
longitudinal(rep by x) controller

Both controllers are used to control motors 

during st run 
wSpeed = 0;
xSpeed = some constant;

during pivot turn
xSpeed = 0;
wSpeed = some constant;

during curved turn
xSpeed = some constant;
wSpeed = some constant;
