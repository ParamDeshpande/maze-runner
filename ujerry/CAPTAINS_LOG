Epoch for software arch.

24/08/19
Received ir sensors.
Completed IMU calibration interface.

28/08/19
All tasks listings.

29/08/19

Controller Epoch
8:56 PM
Encoder testing successful.
someone burned out 1 prototype motor.

30/08/19
6.32 PM
IR sensors testing init.
8.02 PM
IRs are fucked up. Shows 5v op accross LEDs no rev bias current.

3/09/19
Revised design issues, Green ye youtube guy was a huge help.

4/09/19
Aimed to complete IMU yaw values and sensor fusion and
look into Software OS (pref sEOS or systic timers).
9.34pm
Dont know how my code is running the first time ?
Code and design completed for kalman6d used matlabC coder.
(now you know how :) )

5/09/19
Corrected/modified kalman code Successfully imported and run kalman code in main.ino
Looked into curved turnings.
Research on timers.
Thinking of moving to standard embedded IDEs instead of Arduino IDE for timer simplicity and using sEOS or systic time settings.

6/09/19
12.20pm
Going forward with arduino IDE, not using embedded codes.
New changes in kalman code reverifying needed.

10/09/19
10 days to competetion
Completed IR firing pattern code.
Purchased batteries 850mAhx2 ~40C, motor driver ICs l293d x2, Bought new IR pairs(x10) for IR sensor module.

11/09/19
9 days to go
Resolved IR header object issues.
